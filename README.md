# UCSMA Docs
Documentations for all UCSMA projects.

## Overview
The generated documentation site can be found here: https://ucsma-project.github.io/docs/. The site uses Jekyll theme [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/), and the home page is located at [index.md](./index.md). The [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme provides responsive site for documentations and natively supports site-wise searching.

To add contents to this docs site, first add a short overview in the [home page](./index.md), then add a subpage (a seperate `.md` file) with the appropriate YAML front matter.
